# API — Project

Short, clear instructions for working with the project environment and dependencies.

---

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.13 installed
- Git (optional)
- PowerShell (on Windows) or another shell

---

## Setup

1. (Optional) Create a virtual environment
```powershell
python -m venv env
```

2. Activate the environment (PowerShell)
```powershell
.\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
- Windows CMD:
```cmd
.\env\Scripts\activate
```
- Git Bash / WSL:
```bash
source env/Scripts/activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Notes
- Keep the virtual environment out of source control (add `env/` to .gitignore).
- If activation is blocked by PowerShell execution policy, run PowerShell as Administrator and allow scripts:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
